# ReimeFinder

Texteditor to write poems, can generate rhymes 

It is and was an old project which needs a lot of attention if it should ever be able to generate a rhyme again. 
The structor needs a hole rework and also the way of saving data in the database is neither efficient nor easy to support.
The Interface is fine, but this project might be ported to Java or C++ if I find time for that
